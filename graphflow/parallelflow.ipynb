      "Climate change refers to significant alterations in global temperatures and weather patterns over time, primarily driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These actions release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, leading to an enhanced greenhouse effect that warms the planet. As a result, we are witnessing more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity. Urgent action is needed to mitigate its impacts through transitioning to renewable energy sources, promoting sustainable practices, and increasing awareness and adaptation efforts globally.\n",
